# Phi Retakes Math: From C+ to B-
We are trying to address the challenge of improving the performance of small language models (SLMs) on math problem-solving tasks without relying on large amounts of labeled data. Specifically, they focus on enabling self-improvement in SLMs using unlabeled data, which is a significant departure from the traditional approach of scaling up model and dataset sizes to achieve performance gains


## To run this code:

pip install -r requirements.txt


To start iterative learning or self improvement:
python learning_driver.py

To test training code:
python math_llm.py

To test code interpreter:
python code_interpreter.py
